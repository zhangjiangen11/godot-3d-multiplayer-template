# Godot 3D Multiplayer Template

This is a foundational template for a 3D multiplayer game, developed in Godot Engine 4.4. It offers a starting structure for your next multiplayer project, including essential functionalities for players to interact and communicate in real-time.


> This template is also available on the [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/3377) and [Godot Asset Store](https://store-beta.godotengine.org/asset/devmoreir4/godot-3d-multiplayer-template/).

## Key Features

This template provides everything you need to kickstart your multiplayer game development:

* **Network System:** A base for managing client-server connections, allowing multiple players to connect and interact within the same environment.
* **Player Management:** Easily add multiple players to the game, controlling their interactions and movement in a 3D space.
* **Real-Time Synchronization:** Player movements and animations are smoothly synchronized, ensuring a consistent experience for everyone.
* **Player Name Displayed:** Each player's nickname is shown above their character for easy identification.
* **Player Skin Selection:** Players can choose from four skin options (red, green, blue, or yellow) to personalize their avatars.
* **Global Multiplayer Chat:** An integrated chat system allows players to communicate in real-time with everyone in the game.
* **Multiplayer Inventory System:** Server-authoritative inventory management with 20-slot grid layout, real-time drag-and-drop functionality.
